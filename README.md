# ASAP | AI Narrative Engine

**Accelerated Stories. Automated Prompts.**
ASAP is a futuristic, web-based prompt engineering interface designed to optimize narratives for the next generation of AI video models, including **Kling AI**, **Google Veo**, **OpenAI Sora**, and **Runway Gen-4**.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Multi-Model Intelligence**: tailored optimization rules for:
    -   **Kling AI 1.6** (Master Shots, Action)
    -   **Google Veo** (Cinematic, Native Audio)
    -   **OpenAI Sora** (Physics, Long-form)
    -   **Runway Gen-4** (Commercial Motion)
    -   **Luma Dream Machine** (Abstract/Surreal)
-   **Director Mode**: Automatically injects professional camera terminology ("Truck Left", "Orbit", "Crash Zoom") based on the strengths of the selected model.
-   **Scene Splitting**: Intelligently breaks down raw narrative text into prompt-ready scenes.
-   **Photo Restoration**: Dedicated mode for upscaling, colorizing, and restoring vintage photography.
-   **Solar Flare Theme**: A premium, glassmorphism-based UI with deep void backgrounds and amber/crimson accents.

## 🧠 Logic Core 5.0 (Visual Director)

The engine now thinks like a film crew, not a text generator:
1.  **Visual Translator**: Converts abstract concepts ("lazy", "angry") into concrete pixel-level descriptions ("slouched posture", "veins popping").
2.  **Variable Isolation**: Prevents attribute bleeding by strictly scoping narratives to specific subjects using weighted syntax `(Subject:1.2)`.
3.  **Scene Manager**: Enforces continuity by distinguishing between Global Context (Highway) and Local Context (Car Interior).
4.  **Token Economy**: Automatically strips narrative fluff ("suddenly", "then") to prioritize visual tokens.
5.  **Motion Dynamics**: Assigns camera movements (Steadicam vs. SnorriCam) based on action intensity.

## 🛠️ Usage

1.  **Select Mode**: Toggle between "Video Narrative" and "Restoration".
2.  **Input Data**: Paste your script, story concept, or image description.
3.  **Choose Model**: Select the target AI engine (e.g., *Kling AI*).
4.  **Process**: Click "Process Request".
5.  **Direct**: Copy the optimized prompts, complete with camera directions and style tags, ready for generation.

## 📦 Setup

ASAP is a client-side web application. No build step required.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/asap-engine.git
    ```
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
    -   *Recommended: Use a local server (e.g., Live Server) to prevent CORS issues with local assets.*
